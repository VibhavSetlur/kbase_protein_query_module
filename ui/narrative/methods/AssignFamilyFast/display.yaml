        short-hint : |
            Paste a protein embedding (JSON array of floats) to assign it to a family by similarity to the medoid.
        long-hint  : |
            The embedding should be a JSON array of floats, as output by the GenerateProteinEmbeddings app. The app will return the best-matching family, a confidence score, and the medoid (eigenprotein) representative.

description : |

    <p>This App assigns a protein embedding to a family by computing similarity to the medoid (not classification). It is extremely fast and ideal for quick lookup tasks.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><b>Input:</b> Protein embedding (JSON array of floats)</li>
    <li><b>Output:</b> Family ID, confidence score, and medoid (eigenprotein) ID</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Use this app after generating an embedding for your protein of interest. The result can be used for downstream similarity search or network analysis.</p>
