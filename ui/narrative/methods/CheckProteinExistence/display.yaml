            Protein ID (UniProt)
        short-hint : |
            Enter the UniProt ID of the protein to check for existence in the database.
        long-hint  : |
            The UniProt accession or protein identifier. The app will search the KBase Protein Network for this protein and return its existence status, family, and available metadata.

    <p>This App allows you to quickly check if a protein, specified by its UniProt ID, exists in the KBase Protein Network Analysis Toolkit's database. If the protein is found, the app will return the family in which it is located and any available metadata (such as organism, function, and annotation details).</p>

    <p>This is the first step in a modular protein analysis pipeline. You can use this app to verify the presence of your protein of interest before proceeding to generate embeddings, search for similar proteins, or visualize results.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><b>Input:</b> UniProt protein ID (e.g., P12345)</li>
    <li><b>Output:</b> Existence confirmation, family ID, and metadata (if found)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For more advanced analysis, use the <b>GenerateProteinEmbeddings</b> app to compute embeddings, or <b>FindTopMatchesFromEmbedding</b> to search for similar proteins.</p>
