            Protein ID (UniProt)
        short-hint : |
            Enter the UniProt ID of the protein to generate an embedding for (optional if sequence is provided).
    sequence :
        ui-name : |
            Protein Sequence
        short-hint : |
            Enter the amino acid sequence of the protein (optional if UniProt ID is provided).
        long-hint  : |
            Provide either a UniProt ID or a raw amino acid sequence. The app will generate a protein embedding using a state-of-the-art model (e.g., ESM-2).

description : |

    <p>This App generates a high-dimensional embedding for a protein, using either its UniProt ID or amino acid sequence. Embeddings capture structural and functional properties of proteins, and are used for similarity search, clustering, and network analysis in downstream steps.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><b>Input:</b> UniProt protein ID and/or protein sequence</li>
    <li><b>Output:</b> Embedding vector and summary information</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Use this app after confirming your protein exists in the database, or to generate embeddings for novel proteins. The resulting embedding can be used in the <b>FindTopMatchesFromEmbedding</b> app to search for similar proteins.</p>
